The lights by default can be tweaked with the trim pots to control speed, brightness, etc. However, if you put a jumper on the RC pins and reboot, then you will be able to send commands to the lights via serial communication. This allows for more precise control over the lighting effects and the ability to trigger effects remotely.

If you place the jumper on whilst the lights are running, the current setup from the trim pots will be saved to the EEPROM and used as a default.
